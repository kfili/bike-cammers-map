## Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles
- Unsolved:
  - Add embeded youtube subscribe buttons
  - Add a map with markers showing where youtube channels are active.
  - When adding new channels, there should be a d drop down for city, country (geolocation)
<br>
- Major Hurdles:
  - adding a map, proved to wide a scope, so the feature has been removed for now.
  - debugging the chain of actions for the edit functionality.
  - debugging non-functioning buttons/etc that produce no errors in console.
